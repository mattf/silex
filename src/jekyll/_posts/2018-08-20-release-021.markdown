Silex 0.2.1 is released!

Here are the main improvements and additions:

* The [SampleSink](https://silex.radanalytics.io/latest/api/#io.radanalytics.silex.util.samplesink) class is now generalized to support arbitrary numeric types with `Fractional` and `NumericLimits` instances.
* Minor performance improvements and code cleanups in the self-organizing map implementation.
* This will be the last release to support Scala 2.10.
